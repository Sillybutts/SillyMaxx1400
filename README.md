The SillyMaxx 1400 is a homemade shell for the Nerf Titan air blaster. This design takes the air tank and air pump of the Titan, and puts it into a shell modelled after the Larami SuperMaxx 500 and Larami SuperMaxx 2000 (later called the Supermaxx 5000, produced by Nerf). 

MegaXL Performance using the included barrel: 115 avg out of Trivictus barrel, 12 pumps (stock Titan OPRV goes off at 12).

You can still use original Titan missiles/rockets with the included barrels. 

This blaster is not as cleanly assembled as my other designs. It was mainly made as a personal project. It is still not *hard* to build, but its certainly more involved than building a printed blaster straight from a hardware kit. There is glue.

## Hardware and Assembly

Hardware:
- 1x Titan Tank and pump
- 26x Titan shell screws, or 4-40 screws. You don't need all of them for the blaster to be sturdy, but the holes are there anyway.
- 2x "longer" screws. These are for securing the Frontblock to the rest of the blaster. I used #4 x 1/2 inch pan head phillips screws. You could probably use the longest screws from the original Titan's shell. Basically, it needs to be a nice long, coarse thread screw that fits in the two holes in the front of the Frontblock. 
- Glue. I used Super Glue / Cyanoacrylate glue.

Here is my video, explaining how to assemble the blaster: https://youtu.be/TCJiuXc-gHQ

TlDr, 
- screw together the things with screw holes, glue together the things without screw holes. 
- Attaching the Faux tank needs no screws or glue, it just dovetails on. 
- Don't glue the Faux tank's back "pipe" into the body of the blaster, because then you can't remove the Faux tank to do any tank maintenance if need be. 
- The tank and pump are NOT glued or screwed directly into, they are just friction fit and sandwhiched into the blaster. 
- The trigger should only really be used with the Faux tank in place, or else it will bend slightly up, slightly bending the tank's release pin, causing leaks. 

## Tank and Pump Minimization

To be used in the SillyMaxx 1400 design, a stock Titan tank and Titan pump need to be slightly minimized. These minimizations do not increase the power of the blaster, they just make the tank and pump slightly slimmer.

## Print Info

All STLs were exported in print orientation. STEP and F3D are also provided.

Some parts need brims, a lot of parts need supports. This blaster is NOT as cleanly printed as my other designs.

I recommend rafts for the BodyBlockA and BodyBlockB parts, to keep them straight, and to make the supports easier to remove. I use Cura tree supports. 

The smaller parts (Trigger bits, tank pipe parts, the front cover rings, modules for the top of the faux tank, grip panels etc) should be printed at high infill. I did them at 20% gyroid infill, 4 walls.

The MegaXL barrels included in the fileset should be printed at 5 walls, at least 20% infill. 

The large parts (BodyBlockA,B,C, Faux Tank, Frontblock, etc) and the pump grip can be printed at lower infill and wall count. I did them at 5-10% gyroid infill, 3 walls.
